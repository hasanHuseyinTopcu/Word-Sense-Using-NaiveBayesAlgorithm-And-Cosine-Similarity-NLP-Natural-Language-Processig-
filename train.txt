They believed also that the gravest `waste" , crying out for reduction, was on unemployment relief, though the bankers, more <tag "512274">generous</> than the May committee, were prepared to have their confidence restored by a 10 per cent. cut instead of 20 per cent.

It is the portrait of a brash, insensitive but privately vulnerable man, who suffered from being portrayed as the comic perpetrator of `Goldwynisms": `the public stayed away in droves", `include me out", and many more, many apocryphal.

Although Hanson announced on Tuesday night that the new bid, accepted by the ConsGold board, is a full #1 higher that the #14.30 cash offer tabled two weeks ago, the City sees the 67-year-old Lord Hanson at his craftiest in the way he has revised his bid to win the backing of the ConsGold board.

And I suppose there's a sense in which the child gains because the parents are that much happier and fulfilled? 
Yes, the frustrated mother can't be <tag "512274">generous</> and so forth with her child, and on the whole I think the emphasis that people used to put on mothers staying at home was very misguided, because a mother who's having to sacrifice all her outside interests for the sake of her child is just a frustrated mother, and it's not good for the &ellip. also the problem is that you then have fairly energetic women devoting all they have to children, then they over-invest in the child's own achievements, so in fact you are putting a great psychological burden on the child because it has to grow up fulfilling expectations of an adult, which is not right for a child.

George Lansbury himself became one of the first reforming Poor Law Guardians in East London in the 1890s, and the social legislation of the Liberals, including the state Old Age Pension introduced in 1908, was a direct response to the rising political influence of the labour movement.

Congress was expected to approve an aid package of between dollars 780m ( #520m) and dollars 800m for Poland and Hungary yesterday, well below the scale of the US Marshall Aid given to Western Europe in 1948-1951. 
It was too late to expand this package, but the Solidarity leader seemed to be pitching for <tag "512309">generous</> US government aid next year and, more urgently, for a flood of private investment.

The CBI makes two important points. 
The first is that, with the consumer being the main culprit in the spending boom which led to the current difficulties, there is a case for shifting the tax burden from industry to individuals. 
This could be achieved by limiting the increase in personal tax allowances, and using the money saved to, for example, introduce more <tag "512309">generous</> depreciation allowances against new investment. 

800164
But it is as a scholar of Irish literature, ancient as well as modern, that Mercier will be best remembered. 
He was one of the first to understand the underlying role of ethnic religion in the Anglo-Irish tradition and to research the social background of nineteenth-century writing and in particular the influence of the evangelical revival on it, especially those writers like Shaw and Beckett who rejected religion in their personal lives but made its echoes, images and traditions part of their writing. 
Vivian Mercier's kindness to students, his <tag "512274">generous</> encouragement and help to young scholars, and his collegiality were legendary.

In the summer of 1918 there was a new wave of strikes, concerned less with wages than with questions of status: a strike by munition workers in Coventry against further `dilution" ; a strike by the London police for recognition of their union; strikes by the cotton workers against their humiliating dependence on their `rota" . 
Churchill, though previously <tag "512274">generous</> with increased wages," wanted firm action, and indeed broke the strike at Coventry by threatening to draft the strikers into the army.

Under amendments passed by a joint session in the Kremlin of the Supreme Soviet to the existing 1988 legislation on co-operatives, local authorities are henceforth empowered to set `maximum price levels" &dash. in other words controls &dash. on prices charged by co-operatives for essential public goods. 
At the same time, the state will have the right to set prices for products it buys from co-operatives under contract, and in cases where the co-operative is merely selling on, with a <tag "512309">generous</> mark-up, scarce goods that it has been able to purchase at controlled prices from normal state suppliers.

Unlike Mr Ridley, Mr Walker did not provide a detailed breakdown of what the charges would have been for each authority if the poll tax had been in effect in the current financial year.

The 81p Pendragon share price is worth around 4p per Williams share, with five Pendragon shares allocated for every 100 Williams.

Zola is known to have gathered information about all of these famous courtesans, and he must have realized that they, and others like them, were often regarded as astute, quick-witted women, capable of holding their own in conversation with men of education and culture. 
But this aspect of the courtisane myth, dear to the likes of Saint-Victor, did not capture Zola's imagination. 
On the contrary, in the notes he took on conversations with two friends, Edmond Laporte and Ludovic Hale&acute.vy, whom he quizzed about their extensive experience in the world of haute cocotterie, he tends to select details that underline the good-natured qualities of the women (they love the countryside, are <tag "512274">generous</> with the needy, not given to jealousy, indolent).

The Tottenham midfielder, who was not even an automatic choice when England flew to Sardinia for their opening group F matches, proved with his performance in last night's semi-final against West Germany that he is set to become a permanent fixture in the England line-up. 
Although he collected his second caution of the tournament and will miss Saturday's third-place play-off against Italy in Bari, Gascoigne showed enough skill, energy, vision and maturity in his contest with West German captain Lothar Matthaus to warrant equal billing. 
England manager Bobby Robson, often wary in the past of Gascoigne's lack of discipline on the pitch, was <tag "512274">generous</> with his praise afterwards.

If the SWCs find it uneconomic to raise capital through an equity issue and if debt finance is also difficult to obtain on reasonable terms then they may be forced to seek outside partners.

Yesterday, Mr Ridley rejected the accusation of `significant maladministration" made by the commissioner, Sir Anthony Barrowclough. 
In spite of this, the Secretary of State told the House of Commons that `substantial payments" would be paid to the investors who had lost money as a result of the failure.

THOSE hoping for a reawakening of German cinema are likely to have come away from this year's Munich Film Fest slightly irritated with most current German offerings.

Some new measures had, of course, been necessary, but on the whole changes brought about by the war were less incisive than they had been in 1914. 
Not least, the absence of any serious rationing of consumer goods, and the large number of exemptions from military service for skilled workers and farmers made it appear that the regime was well in control of developments, did not fear a war on the 1914-18 scale, and was even rather <tag "512274">generous</> in its provisioning arrangements.

The non-provided schools, unless they were absorbed totally into the public system, had a choice of status. 
Some became voluntary aided, preserving a considerable measure of autonomy, receiving full support for all their annual running costs and a <tag "512309">generous</> subsidy (at first 50 per cent, but in later decades rising to 80 per cent) towards the capital costs of building.

Schemes will have to guarantee increases in benefits.

A man of great courage and a very devoted friend, he astonished many in his old age by the freshness of his curiosity and his readiness to experiment.

But the sunshine in Mr Major's vision may be felt, just, by the end of 1991, with inflation down to 5%, growth recovering and interest rates on the wane.

The Court of Appeal refused to cut the award made in February to Radojka Gojkovic, 49, in the Family Division of the High Court.

The cost of such a scheme is hard to estimate, since it depends on the size of the annual limit, and on the take-up. 
But the IFS estimate that the first-year cost is unlikely to be more than #1bn, even with a relatively <tag "512309">generous</> #10,000 limit, and could be much less.   

800269
The long-term solution to the ambulance dispute does not lie in nationwide reviews by a committee staffed from among the great and the good. 
Still less does it lie in automatic linkage to, say, the top quartile of average earnings of manual workers, on the lines of the rather <tag "512309">generous</> agreements accepted by firefighters and the police.

The 24-year-old forward is already on the representative ladder after only six games of rugby league, following his summer move to Simms Cross from Widnes rugby union club.

Present in the coach from Victoria Station to the village of Langham, Rutland is a handful of die-hard Warlockians, including a retired head of the BBC World Service Music department and a freelance musician responsible for composition of the Monty Python `Lumberjack" song. 
They tell me that Warlock himself was a vigorous champion of real ale ('Chemists's beer makes me puke and with anger I snort," he once complained), so our trip to Ruddles, a brewery which has been <tag "512274">generous</> in its sponsorship of this society, is partly out of deference for the composer's roistering delight in consumption of the Real Thing.

At Christchurch the university stood to welcome His  Majesty.

So we now know how a big and profitable a business is for sale. 
But there is not yet enough information to put a price on it &dash. except perhaps to say that the shares will have to carry a <tag "512309">generous</> yield, say 8 per cent, if they are to be attractive.

800295
Much has been made in the media of the low charge set by Wandsworth Council, leading people to believe that Wandsworth is a very low-spending borough. 
In fact, at #1,200 per head it is one of the highest spenders in the country and the low charge has been made possible only by a <tag "512309">generous</> government grant of about #600 per charge payer and payment from the `safety net" (to which Oxfordshire will contribute) of a further #116.

Much of the shrub bed is filled with plants given to her by friends: when she moved in she asked them each for one item from their garden. 
Herself a <tag "512274">generous</> gardener, she prefers lush abundance to arid neatness and tends to leave flowers alone if they seed themselves.

I am proud to have played a modest part. 
Throughout this period you have been unfailingly kind and <tag "512274">generous</> to me at times of personal and political difficulty.

And she did. 
Another welcome visitor to 51 Milton Road was Cousin May, a distant relation of Susan Owen's. 
She had a tongue even racier than Miss Taylor's and such an abundance of <tag "512274">generous</> vitality that her annual visits were preceded by weeks of excited anticipation.

`Nowhere in its defence has Pearl produced any convincing evidence that it is able to reverse its long-term decline." 
Urging Pearl shareholders to accept its offer, Australian Mutual said: `This is a very <tag "512309">generous</> offer, bearing in mind that Pearl has grown at half the rate of the industry for the last 10 years and seen its market position fall from second place in 1977 to seventeenth place in 1988."   

800305
Even more depressing figures can be produced over the period 1969-78 where a different classification series showed the proportion of undergraduate applications through UCCA, coming from administrative and professional families, rose from 44 per cent of the total to 51 per cent, with a corresponding decline in the proportion coming from white-collar and blue-collar families. 
Thus, over 20 years, little progress has been made in widening access into UK universities even with the backing of a student-support system which, by any international comparison, has been a <tag "512309">generous</> one.
