It says the figure is half that number but seems to be ignoring Tigray, all of which is in rebel hands. 
The politics of this famine have made UN agencies and other governments nervous about taking public initiatives but if there is a <tag>generous</> public response they will be encouraged to do more.

Beds have also closed at King's Lynn in Norfolk and in Manchester; Newcastle upon Tyne health authority has deferred a decision on whether to restrict services to deal with a #1.9m overspend, while Basingstoke and Southampton are among the districts facing significant overspends. 
The fresh round of closures comes after Kenneth Clarke, Secretary of State for Health, won what appeared to be the most <tag>generous</> settlement for the NHS for some years last November.

Elizabeth Stevens, at Curtis Brown Ltd, Lewis's literary agents, has also been kind and helpful. 
I am greatly indebted to all those who, over the years, have shared their memories of C. S. Lewis with me, either as a friend, a teacher, or a figure on the horizon. 
In particular, I should thank Lady Dunbar of Hempriggs (ne&acute.e Maureen Moore) and her husband Leonard Blake for their <tag>generous</> hospitality and the ready way in which they shared their memories with me; likewise Douglas Gresham.

The cost of such a scheme is hard to estimate, since it depends on the size of the annual limit, and on the take-up. 
But the IFS estimate that the first-year cost is unlikely to be more than #1bn, even with a relatively <tag>generous</> #10,000 limit, and could be much less.

He roams the world like the Flying Dutchman or the Duke of Windsor, except that he doesn't find the travel irksome, as they did. 
I conclude that he was made redundant on <tag>generous</> terms some years ago.

The sheer volume of information was always going to bring presentational problems, although to be fair to the water industry its pathfinder is no more impenetrable than those of previous privatisations. 
A slimmed-down version of the prospectus will be sent to potential investors but the inaccessibility of the pathfinder serves only to support the view that the attraction of this issue will come from <tag>generous</> pricing on the part of the Government rather than a thorough understanding of the prospects for the water businesses.

Present in the coach from Victoria Station to the village of Langham, Rutland is a handful of die-hard Warlockians, including a retired head of the BBC World Service Music department and a freelance musician responsible for composition of the Monty Python `Lumberjack" song. 
They tell me that Warlock himself was a vigorous champion of real ale ('Chemists's beer makes me puke and with anger I snort," he once complained), so our trip to Ruddles, a brewery which has been <tag>generous</> in its sponsorship of this society, is partly out of deference for the composer's roistering delight in consumption of the Real Thing.

Rose Brady's attention had been as unexpected as it had been sudden and welcome. 
It was as if she had fallen out of a <tag>generous</> sky.

Their country life had been meanly different. 
When they were rich and famous, they would be <tag>generous</> once more.
